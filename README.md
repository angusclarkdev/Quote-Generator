## Quote Generator
A small program which allows the user to generate a random quote from some of the books I've read in the last year. Idea and styling inspired by [Jessa Bean](https://github.com/jessabean/literary-notes).
* Utilises objects and array to store quotes
* Pulls quote at random using a Math.floor(Math.random) function
* Prints quote in document using function which grabs the destination (element) and replaces text using "innerText".

### Things learned:
* I need to learn more about OOP programming.
